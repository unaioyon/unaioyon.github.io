On top of my work on Econometrics, I enjoy exploring new musical directions and digging records! I am also a professionally-trained classical and jazz piano player on my free time. Find some personal favorites below :)

**JAZZ**

[voluptueux & lourd](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3mkrBtfsRoZEKH4tCQHFzJ?si=dc068f9904884c21): dense but mostly melodic tunes from and inspired by the 60s, with a strong presence of blue note and impulse records.

**FLAMENCO**

[la luna y el clavel](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6VL5SwWTtXcSMzrNFsOgg5?si=09fa79ee0b22495e): a (quasi-)orthodox study of *cante jondo*, the purest and deepest form of singing. beautiful memories from my childhood in spain.

**CROONERS**

[sposrtsmen](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/08k2xiyxy8Ku8omOAwpa6D?si=487e232cec1b4b31): male voices from all times and places, an ode to love, heartbreak and the paths that unite them.

**POP and SOUL**

[city pop jewels](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3rOQJJq8KL8FFf9vBzv0US?si=0fa4a97ed1f745e0): an unstructured collection of japanese favorites for nostalgics of the yuppie lifestyle by the pacific ocean.

**R&B and INDIE**

[blue & wet](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/78MK1AUVZ7bocxK5XgEjzX?si=ux-qXUGMQ_yevvvxofxkqw&pi=e-hgsSFml7Rsu7): a very personal exploration of the new wave of korean r&b.
