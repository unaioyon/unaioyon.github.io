On top of my work on Econometrics, I enjoy exploring new musical directions and digging records! I am also a professionally-trained classical and jazz piano player on my free time.

**R&B and INDIE**

[blue & wet](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/78MK1AUVZ7bocxK5XgEjzX?si=ux-qXUGMQ_yevvvxofxkqw&pi=e-hgsSFml7Rsu7): a very personal exploration of the new wave of Korean R&B.

**POP and SOUL**

[city pop jewels](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3rOQJJq8KL8FFf9vBzv0US?si=0fa4a97ed1f745e0): an unstructured collection of Japanese favorites for nostalgics of the yuppie lifestyle by the Pacific Ocean.

**JAZZ**

[voluptueux & lourd](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3mkrBtfsRoZEKH4tCQHFzJ?si=dc068f9904884c21): dense but mostly melodic tunes from and inspired by the 60s, with a strong presence of Blue Note and Impulse records.
