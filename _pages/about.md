**I am currently visiting [Brown University](https://economics.brown.edu/) invited by [Toru Kitagawa](https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/torukitagawa). Starting in February 2026, I will be visiting [Ashesh Rambachan](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/ashesh-rambachan) at the [MIT](https://economics.mit.edu/).**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Econometrics at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/). My projects are supervised by [Luc Behaghel (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/behaghel-luc/behaghel.htm) and [Cl√©ment de Chaisemartin (Sciences Po)](https://sites.google.com/site/clementdechaisemartin/).

My primary research fields are Econometrics and Labor Economics, with a particular interest in panel data models, optimal transport and partial identification. I also do applied research using French administrative data on the universe of unemployment spells.
