I am a second year Ph.D. candidate in Econometrics and Economics at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/). My projects are supervised by [Luc Behaghel (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/behaghel-luc/behaghel.htm) and [Cl√©ment de Chaisemartin (Sciences Po)](https://sites.google.com/site/clementdechaisemartin/).

My primary research fields are Econometrics and Labor Economics, with a particular interest in factor models, partial identification with panel data and optimal transport for identification. I also do applied research using French administrative data on the universe of unemployment spells.

I will visit [CEMFI](https://cemfi.es/) in summer 2025, invited by [Manuel Arellano](https://www.cemfi.es/~arellano/). I am also a Fellow at [Future Policy Lab](https://www.futurepolicylab.com/equipo/), and I visited the [Bank of Spain](https://www.bde.es/wbe/en/) in summer 2024.
